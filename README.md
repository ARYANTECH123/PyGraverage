# Python Graverage
A interpreter for the Graverage language/automation in Python

## What is Graverage?
Graverage is a 2D automation that mutates point positions on the basis of associations with other points.

Theese associations are in the form of 'bags', which are sets of point mapped to each point.

A full, detailed explanation can be found [here](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Graverage)

## How to use
First, ensure you have Python 3+ installed.
Place the `grv.py` file in your working directory.

To run a file, use the command `py grv.py -e 1 -f filename.txt`.

Here, the `-e` sets your execution depth, or mow many times the instruction list is run.
